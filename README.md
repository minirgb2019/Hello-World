# Hello-World
Overview
This project creates communication between a client and a server through TCP, which can respond to a requests including numbers or a string.
Test
I used a client side and a server side command to test the codes, so I switched. 
For Qhello project, I need to change directory to Documents/test1, which I saved my java codes, or the screen showed error:file not found: client.java.

I typed Javac and the client side file name called client.java, then I typed Javac and the server side file name called server.java. When the screen showed nothing, it means this compile process worked.
The files in my folder including client.txt and server.txt, after I ran javac client, and client.txt would change into client.class and client.java. I ran javac server, and server.txt would change into server.class and server.java.
I ran the server first. I typed java server.java. After it, I typed java client.java and ran it. I could see "client connected" on the screen.
